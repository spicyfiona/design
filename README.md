# Hi I'm Fiona
I am: a ~~plastic/visual surgeon~~ / designer who concentrates on designing experiences of products and services. Sometimes I'm a visual designer; or UX/UI designer and/or a project manager. Technically titles don't prove enough of what I do. But what I { â™¥ } doing is collaborating on ideas* and building on innovations that could be of some helfpul use for people .

*_till it becomes a hyped-up-moment thing then suddenly dies down from constant life changes and over-evolvement_:sob::neutral_face::sob::neutral_face:

## Fiona's design traits:
:open_hands:  Be Empathetic (patience goes a long way)<br>
:smiley:  Ask Questions (seriously, ~~assumptions~~ i, you, them, everyone can't read minds)<br>
:zap:  Try first & test quick (just do it)<br>
:sparkles:  Share openly & credit everyone<br>

### Fiona's creative process is "always improvising"...:zany_face:
Seen in my cooking, and the way I handle if nothing goes right, there will be plan B (at least). I've learnt to become cross-functional, open minded and adaptable. A lot of my creative works is because of interests and personal experiences with interactive digital-art:movie_camera:, immersive entertainment:video_game:, tactile workshops:scissors:, digital/mobile photography:camera: and especially hackathons:computer:
