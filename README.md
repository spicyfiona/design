# Hi I'm Fiona

I'm a design technologist who concentrates on pragmatic -- {universal} design experiences in products and services. Sometimes I'm a visual designer; or a User Experience (UX) / User Interaction (UI) designer and project manager. Technically titles doesn't prove enough of what I do... But what I { â™¥ } is collaborating on ideas* and expanding experimentation that could be helpful or intrigue likeminded-people.

*_till it becomes a hyped-up-moment thing then suddenly dies down from constant life changes and over-evolvement_:sob::neutral_face::sob::neutral_face:

## Fiona's traits:
:open_hands:  Being empathetic (seeing the other side's perspective, goes a long way)<br>
:raised_hands:  Ask Questions (~~assumptions~~ i, you, them, everyone can't read minds)<br>
:zap:  Tinker testing (these Ah-HA! moments spark inspiration, just test it)<br>
:sparkles:  Share appreciations, retrospectively, looking to where we got to, it wouldn't have been possible from the above<br>

My `(un)secret` recipe: <br>
>Creative process involves questioning, snacking and improvising ðŸ¤ª <br>
With every delicious challenge, there will always be a **sweet**, **salty**, **sour**, **bitter** and **spicy** moment.<br>
I live for the spicy chaos, recover through the sour / bitterness with open retrospects and always sprinkle lots of sweetness with alternative plans to uplift moods. This is how I've become who I am today :smile:
