# Hi I'm Fiona
I am: a ~~plastic surgeon~~ / designer who concentrates on product designing; sometimes I'm a visual design; or UX/UI design and even project manager. Technically titles doesn't prove enough what I do. But what I  { â™¥ }  doing is collaborating on ideas* and building on innovations that connect with people because of experiences.

*_it becomes a hyped-up moment thing then suddenly dies down of constant life changes and evolvement_:sob::neutral_face::sob::neutral_face:

## fiona-design/traits
:open_hands:  Be Empathetic (patience goes a long way)<br>
:smiley:  Ask Questions (seriously, ~~assumptions~~ i, you, them, everyone can't read minds)<br>
:neckbeard:  Try first & test quick (just do it)<br>
:sparkles:  Share & credit people (the world needs more kind people)<br>

### My creative process is "always improvising"...:stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:
Seen in my cooking, and the way I handle if nothing goes right, there will be plan B (at least). I've learnt to become cross-functional, open minded and adaptable. A lot of my creative works is because of interests and personal experiences with interactive digital-art:movie_camera:, immersive entertainment:video_game:, tactile workshops:scissors:, digital/mobile photography:camera: and especially hackathons:computer:
